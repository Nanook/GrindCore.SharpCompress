# GrindCore.SharpCompress

GrindCore.SharpCompress is an enhanced version of the popular **SharpCompress** library that integrates **GrindCore** native compression technology. This project delivers extensive native compression support built using the **System.IO.Compression** pattern, utilizing compression algorithms directly from their original C implementations.

This enhanced fork replaces GZip, LZMA, Deflate, ZStandard, LZ4, and Brotli implementations with **native C streams** from [GrindCore](https://github.com/Nanook/GrindCore.net), providing significant performance improvements while maintaining full API compatibility.

This compression library supports .NET 9, .NET 8, .NET 6, .NET Standard 2.0+, and .NET Framework 4.8+ and can unrar, un7zip, unzip, untar, unbzip2, ungzip, unlzip with forward-only reading and file random access APIs. Write support for zip/tar/bzip2/gzip/lzip are implemented with enhanced native performance.

The library maintains support for non-seekable streams so large files can be processed on the fly (i.e., download streams), now with native-level performance.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è First Release Notice**: This is the initial release of GrindCore.SharpCompress. While tested with comprehensive unit tests, there may be some rough edges as the library gains real-world usage. Please report any issues encountered to help improve the library.
